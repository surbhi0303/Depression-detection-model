# Depression-detection-model
Problem Statement: “To analyze and detect depression of social media data of
users like Twitter/Instagram/Facebook feed by using machine learning
techniques.”

The Problem solution focuses on the social media platforms  of user such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook which consists of rich amounts of data to perform psychological classification tasks. This model aims to develop a depression detection model using demographic characteristics and sentiment analysis from user's post.                                                                                                                
Data collection and Preparation  : The first step involves collecting data from user's Instagram feed which includes posts, comments, and other user-generated content. Further the data is preprocessed i.e handling missing values, removing irrelevant information, and normalizing text.        

Features Extraction  : The patterns related to depression are extracted from the data. Psychological analysis is all about extracting psychological data from textual data. It is  focused on different types of factors such as emotional process, linguistic cues (e.g., sentiment analysis, word frequency), social network characteristics (e.g., number of connections, interaction patterns), and behavioral indicators (e.g., posting frequency, engagement levels),temporal process, and all features together for the detection and measurement of depressive data received as Instagram feed. 

Model Selection: Supervised machine learning is used in this model to select and train the Instagram data.The classification techniques such as LSTM—for depression detection in post, decision tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and logistic regression are used.

Model training & Measurement : Data preprocessing on datasets and removal of the raw data from the dataset is done . After extracting the values of data from the datasets, training the data of post and cross-validating the training dataset is carried out.  The preprocessed data is split into training and testing data sets. The training set is used to train the selected machine learning model on the extracted features. The model should learn patterns that distinguish between depressed and non-depressed individuals based on their social media behaviour.These algorithms detect depression by plotting graphs. The longitudinal analysis plots the user activities with time, and the results show less social interaction, less positive things, strongly clustered ego networks and increased interrelation. Metrics like F1-score ,accuracy, and precision can assess the model's ability to correctly identify depression cases. The data is then classified into depressive and non depressive.
